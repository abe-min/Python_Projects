## Bill Splitter
Everyone likes eating out with friends. The more friends, the better, but the bill time is always a bummer, to say the least. Why not develop a tool to keep the fun alive and make sure that everyone pays an equal amount.

**Usage**: The script will prompt you for the following inputs:
1. Number of guests joining you for dinner.
2. The  names of the guests joining you for dinner.
3. The total bill amount.
4. If you want to use the "lucky" feature. If used, it will pick one of the guests as "lucky" and their portion will be 0.
